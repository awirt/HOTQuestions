        <p>We are looking for the üî•üå∂Ô∏è <b>HOT-est</b> üå∂Ô∏èüî• non-eliciting questions known to teachers. During classroom visits, I saw that HOT, non-eliciting questions (higher-order, where teacher embeds vocab word) DID lead to student learning outcomes. However, many teachers' hopes and dreams of HOT, non-eliciting questions were derailed by student redirection and the pressure of pacing. To adjust for this, we will be practicing how to <b>redirect</b> students on-the-fly with HOT, non-eliciting questions. The goal is to develop your capacity as a teacher to refine your practice in-the-moment.</p>

        <br>

        <p>On the next page, you will receive a <b>SCENARIO</b> and target <b>VOCABULARY</b>. Your goal is to formulate the HOT-est, non-eliciting question possible in the time given. Once the time is up, you'll share out your question with your group. The group will then decide whose question is the HOT-est. BE CAREFUL! If you write an eliciting question, you will be DISQUALIFIED for that round. The winner of the round takes a point. The teacher with the most points at the end of the game will receive a sweet serenade in the style of Rihanna <i>and</i> lay claim to the title "HOT-est Teacher in CLCs."</p>
